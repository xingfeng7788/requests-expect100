**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.

```python
>>> import requests
>>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
```

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `300M downloads / week` — according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `4,000,000+` repositories.

## Installing Requests and Supported Versions

Requests is available on PyPI:

```console
$ python -m pip install requests
```

Requests officially supports Python 3.10+.

## Supported Features & Best–Practices

Requests is ready for the demands of building robust and reliable HTTP–speaking applications, for the needs of today.

- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
- International Domains and URLs
- Sessions with Cookie Persistence
- Browser-style TLS/SSL Verification
- Basic & Digest Authentication
- Familiar `dict`–like Cookies
- Automatic Content Decompression and Decoding
- Multi-part File Uploads
- SOCKS Proxy Support
- Connection Timeouts
- Streaming Downloads
- Automatic honoring of `.netrc`
- Chunked HTTP Requests
- **Expect: 100-continue Support**

## Expect: 100-continue Support

This fork adds support for the HTTP `Expect: 100-continue` mechanism (RFC 7231), which allows clients to check whether a server will accept a request before sending a large body — saving bandwidth on rejection.

### How it works

1. Client sends request headers with `Expect: 100-continue` (body withheld)
2. Server replies `100 Continue` → client sends the body
3. Server replies with any other status (e.g. `301`, `417`) → client skips the body entirely

### Usage

**Option 1 — `expect100` parameter (recommended):**

```python
import requests

with open("large_file.bin", "rb") as f:
    resp = requests.post("https://example.com/upload", data=f, expect100=True)
```

**Option 2 — manual header (auto-detected):**

```python
resp = requests.post(
    "https://example.com/upload",
    data=large_body,
    headers={"Expect": "100-continue"},
)
```

Both approaches are equivalent. When `expect100=True` is set, the `Expect: 100-continue` header is injected automatically.

### Redirect behaviour

The `Expect` header is automatically stripped on any redirect, so it is never forwarded to the redirect target.

## Cloning the repository

When cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-c
fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit timestamp (see
[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):

```shell
git clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/xingfeng7788/requests-expect100.git
```

You can also apply this setting to your global Git config:

```shell
git config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore
```
